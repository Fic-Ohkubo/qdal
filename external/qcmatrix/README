1. A brief description of the project

   QcMatrix is an ``abstract'' matrix library written in C language (with C++
   and Fortran interface), and provides a special square block complex matrix
   (all the blocks are square matrix with the same dimension) and corresponding
   functions.

   It can be built on top of exteranl C, C++ or Fortran libraries, which have
   implemented either square block complex matrix, square block real matrix,
   complex matrix or real matrix and required functions.

   Please refer to doc/manual.pdf for more details.

   Please refer to RULES if you would like to contribute.
