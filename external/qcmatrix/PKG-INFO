Description: QcMatrix is an ``abstract'' matrix library written in C
   language (with C++ and Fortran interface), and provides a special
   square block complex matrix (all the blocks are square matrix with
   the same dimension) and corresponding functions. It can be built
   on top of exteranl C, C++ or Fortran libraries, which have implemented
   either square block complex matrix, square block real matrix,
   complex matrix or real matrix and required functions.
Platform: Windows, Unix, MacOS
