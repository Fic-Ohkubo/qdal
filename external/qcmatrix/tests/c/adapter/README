Simple example to show how to use external C matrix library (square block real, complex
or real) in QcMatrix.

(1) Copies header files and source codes:
    export PATH_LIB_QCMATRIX=where_QcMatrix_is
    ./init_c_adapter.sh
(2) Creates a build directory:
    mkdir build
    cd build
(3) CMake procedure (setting corresponding parameters):
    ccmake ..
(4) make
(5) QcMatrix CMake procedure:
    LANG_C_HEADER = "where_QcMatrix_is/tests/c/adapter/include/impls/real_mat.h" or
                    "where_QcMatrix_is/tests/c/adapter/include/impls/cmplx_mat.h" or
                    "where_QcMatrix_is/tests/c/adapter/include/impls/block_real.h"
    LANG_C_MATRIX = Matrix_
    QCMATRIX_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES = -ladapter_matrix
    QCMATRIX_EXTERNAL_PATH = where_QcMatrix_is/tests/c/adapter/build
(6) Cleans the adapter
    ./clean_c_adapter.sh
