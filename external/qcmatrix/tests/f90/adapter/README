Simple Fortran 90 matrix library to demonstrate how to use external Fortran
matrix library (square block complex, square block real, complex or real)
in QcMatrix.

(1) Copies header files:
    export PATH_LIB_QCMATRIX=where_QcMatrix_is
    ./init_f_adapter.sh
(2) Creates a build directory:
    mkdir build
    cd build
(3) CMake procedure (setting corresponding parameters):
    ccmake ..
(4) make
(5) QcMatrix CMake procedure:
    LANG_F_MATRIX = Matrix_
    LANG_F_MODULE = real_matrix or cmplx_matrix or block_real or block_cmplx
    QCMATRIX_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES = -ladapter_matrix
    QCMATRIX_EXTERNAL_PATH = where_QcMatrix_is/tests/f90/adapter/build
    QCMATRIX_ROW_MAJOR = OFF
    QCMATRIX_ZERO_BASED = OFF
(6) Cleans the adapter
    ./clean_f_adapter.sh
